### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Antonello Provenzano, originally from Palermo (Sicily), but currently living in Oslo (Norway).

In my day life I work as consultant for IT Architecture at [KnowIt](https://knowit.no), while in my free time I like to hack some open-source projects, and from time to time trying to develop some ideas that might be interesting to test.

My experience as developer started when I was 10 years old and I received from my parents a Commodore-64, that all my friends used to play games, but that I have exploited by using BASIC programs found in a math book. Those were the days!

Aside from my passion for software development, I am also a _TOGAF_ certified architect, _Azure Solutions Architect_ and as _Contributor to the Well-Architected Framework (WAF)_ by [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com).

From time to time I share some thoughts on the matter of _Enterprise Architecture_ on my [personal blog](https://antonello.provenza.no): feel free to reach me out if you have remarks (positive or negative) and ideas.

### Deveel

Many years ago (back in 2001) I established the brand _[Deveel](https://deveel.com)_, that I used to deliver some projects I was working on: at the beginning it was nothing else than a website and a logo, but through time I made it to become an individual legal entity to provide IT consultancy services.

Although the legal entity still exists, I moved on and I returned Deveel to its original scope of an _umbrella_ under which releasing (mainly) open-source projects.

You can explore all the projects released as Deveel in its [GitHub organization space](https://github.com/deveel).

### Open Source Projects

I must admit that, contrary to the past, I am now better at creating new projects, rather than collaborating to existing ones, for the main reason that I am currently just a _hobbist_ developer, since my day job is of another kind (still in IT, but not involving _coding_): I use my free time to experiment new methodologies, technologies and frameworks, and while conducting my experiments and studies, I may find (or _think_ to have found) some open spots that could be of interest for the community.

**Projects I am Working On...**

* **[Deveel.Webhooks](https://github.com/deveel/deveel.webhooks)** - A .NET framework for the management and delivery of _webhooks_ to subscribing applications

**Archived Projects (I was proud of)**

* **[DeveelDB](https://github.com/deveel/deveeldb)** - Formerly named _Minosse RDBMS_, it was the first SQL RDBMS for .NET
* **[CloudB](https://github.com/deveel/cloudb)** - Years (many years) before _Azure CosmosDB_, this was a distributed database system with a hybrid data model (supporting at the same time _Key/Value_, _newSQL_ and _GraphDB_)
