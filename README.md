### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Antonello Provenzano, originally from Palermo (Sicily), but currently living in Oslo (Norway).

In my day life I am the Enterprise Architect of a Norwegian bank, but when the night comes I wear my cape and go around hacking some .NET open-source projects, and from time to time trying to develop some ideas for business applications.

My experience as developer started when I was 10 years old and I received from my parents a Commodore-64, that all my friends used to play games, but that I have exploited by using BASIC programs found in a math book. Those were the days!
